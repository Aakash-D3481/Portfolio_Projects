Project Overview

This project was undertaken to revolutionize the way our organization handles electoral Form 20 data, which is critical for political consulting and research. Traditionally, this data was manually downloaded, cleaned, and analyzed in Excelâ€”a process that was time-consuming, error-prone, and required repetition for each new analysis request.
Problem Statement

    Traditional Method: Data analysis was performed in Excel, taking a minimum of 3 hours per analysis, with no centralized storage for the cleaned data. Each analysis was recreated from scratch, leading to inefficiencies and redundant work.
    Challenges: Inconsistent analysis time, manual repetition, and the lack of a centralized database for storing and accessing large datasets.
