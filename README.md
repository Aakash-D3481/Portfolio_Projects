# Portfolio_Projects

Welcome to my portfolio repository! I am a Data Analyst with over 9 months of experience and currently working in the Research and Consulting (Politics) domain. This repository showcases a selection of my projects that highlight my expertise in data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. These projects demonstrate my proficiency in tools such as Excel, Python and Python Data Analysis Libraries, SQL, Power BI, and Machine Learning, and reflect my ability to derive actionable insights from complex datasets.

Each project folder contains a README file with detailed explanations of the project objectives, methodologies, and findings. Code files are well-documented, and where applicable, datasets are provided for reproducibility.

Feel free to explore the projects, review the code, and reach out if you have any questions or feedback.
