## Project Overview
This project focuses on creating an interactive Power BI dashboard for Blinkit Store, aimed at analyzing sales performance, customer ratings, and key product attributes. The dashboard is designed to provide actionable insights into the impact of outlet characteristics and item types on total sales, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions regarding product distribution and store management.

## Data Collection & Preparation
Data was sourced from Blinkit Store’s sales records and processed to calculate various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), including Total Sales, Average Sales, Total Items, and Average Customer Rating. The data was then cleaned and organized for visualization, ensuring accuracy and clarity.

## Key Analyses Conducted

- Total Sales by Fat Content (Donut Chart): Visualized the effect of fat content on sales performance, helping assess consumer preferences for different fat levels.
  
- Total Sales by Item Type (Bar Chart): Analyzed the performance of various product categories based on sales and related KPIs.
- Fat Content by Outlet for Total Sales (Stacked Column Chart): Compared total sales across outlets, segmented by fat content, to identify how outlet performance 
  varies by product attributes.
- Total Sales by Outlet Establishment (Line Chart): Evaluated how the age or establishment type of outlets influences overall sales.
- Sales by Outlet Size (Donut Chart): Explored the relationship between outlet size and sales performance, helping optimize resource allocation.
- Sales by Outlet Location (Funnel Map): Assessed the geographical distribution of sales to understand regional sales dynamics.
- Metrics by Outlet Type (Matrix Visual): Provided a comprehensive breakdown of all KPIs (total sales, average sales, number of items, and average rating) across 
  different outlet types.

## Dashboard Features
The dashboard is equipped with custom slicers for Outlet Location Type, Outlet Size, and Item Type, enabling stakeholders to filter data dynamically and explore specific insights.

## Outcome
This Power BI dashboard equips Blinkit’s management with valuable insights into sales performance across various dimensions, enhancing their ability to make strategic decisions regarding inventory, outlet expansion, and product offerings.
